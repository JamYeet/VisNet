    <h1>About Our Team</h1>
    
    <!-- Team introduction -->
    <p>
      We are a team of three passionate individuals committed to improving accessibility and interaction through visual speech recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      VisNet was developed as part of our research into AI and deep learning systems. We wanted to create a system that could understand human communication without relying on audio. Our goal is to create and expand technology, making communication more accessible for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team, James (24845998), Gabriel (24787970), and Gangsan (24936888) has combined our understanding of deep learning systems to create an algorithm that can recognise speech from visual cues with increasing accuracy, and we're committed to continuous improvement of our system in our future work.
    </p>
